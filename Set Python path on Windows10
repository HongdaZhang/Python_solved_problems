This file let you know how to set Python path in Windows10 system, especially when you want to set different Python binaries(Python2 
and Python3) in your computer.
Before setting Python path, make sure you have installed Python on your computer.
1. single clik "my computer" --> select "properties";
2. select "high-level system setting" --> select "environment variable" --> select "Path", you can see some existing paths, make sure 
if all Python paths which you have set are already here. For example, there should be some Python paths like these: "C:\Python27\Scripts;
C:\Python27;C:\Users\user's name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts;C:\Users\user's name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\
Python36-32". Take notes: each path are seperated by ";".
3. click "edit" --> select "edit text"
4. find all Python path in your computer, copy these paths and paste in the text. If you don't kown your Python path, in "commond line"
type "python" --> "import sys" --> "sys.path", then you can find some paths like examples in step.2.
5. you'd better change Python3 path file "python.exe" to "python3.exe", so you can type "python" for using Python2 and "python3" for using 
Python3.
